# Python-Class-Project - Covid Data
### By: Nermin, Sanjaya, Ian, Stephanie

1. We have begun investigating the data which contains a lot of socio-economic information. Based on this these are some questions we are hoping to answer 

2. Does socio-economic status (poverty, countries GDP) impact the risk of hospitalization and mortality? 

3. Does temperature or other geographic characteristics influence how rapidly COVID-19 spreads? 

4. Do pre-existing conditions impact death or infection rate (diabetes, cardiovascular, obesity, and smoking)?
